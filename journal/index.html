        <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
        <p>The article covers the main practices of designing a form that allows for good user experience. This includes the structuring of the form that prevents any confusion for the users and reduces cognitive load. 
        The tip that specifically caught my interest was the multiple steps as it allows for chunking of information and the progress bar showing how far the form has completed, which  encourages users to likely complete the form. 
        Most of the practices mentioned in the article are common patterns that are used in most online platforms, which people usually follow to allow their form to work smoothly for their users. 
        Some of the practices can be applied to some scenarios but not all. For example, the practice of minimizing dropdown menus can be based on
        when there may not be enough space in the page or having a dropdown menu of yes and no is also commonly used.

        Although it is not necessarily a form, the step by step login phase reduces the users’ cognitive load. <a href="https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login">(Link)</a></p>
