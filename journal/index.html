        <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows </h2>
        <p>The article goes over when modals are appropriate to use in UI design. It is useful to save the screen without having the user go to another page.
        However, it can provide a negative user experience when it's not used appropriately. Such instances include having a pop up modal when a user first enters the website. 
        This can easily annoy them and make them click away. Users are more likely to do something when they do the action themselves such as clicking a button on the page. Modals can be used to 
        obtain additional information from the users or provide information for users along with the parent page. The article further discusses accessibility in a modal by making information visible and clear to the user. Structuring of information and the modal itself should also be clear 
        and accessible. When using a modal, designers should ask themselves when it's appropriate to use it. They should consider the significance of it and the benefits or harm to the users.

        <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
        <p>The article covers the main practices of designing a form that allows for good user experience. This includes the structuring of the form that prevents any confusion for the users and reduces cognitive load. 
        The tip that specifically caught my interest was the multiple steps as it allows for chunking of information and the progress bar showing how far the form has completed, which  encourages users to likely complete the form. 
        Most of the practices mentioned in the article are common patterns that are used in most online platforms, which people usually follow to allow their form to work smoothly for their users. 
        Some of the practices can be applied to some scenarios but not all. For example, the practice of minimizing dropdown menus can be based on
        when there may not be enough space in the page or having a dropdown menu of yes and no is also commonly used.

        <h2>Website form with best practices</h2>
        <p>One of the website forms that demonstrates the best practices is the Spotify sign in interface. 
        Although it is not necessarily a form, the step by step login phase reduces the users’ cognitive load. <a href="https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login">(Link)</a></p>
